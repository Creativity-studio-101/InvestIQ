## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js for REST API endpoints
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon Database)
- **Development Server**: TSX for TypeScript execution in development

### Project Structure
- `client/` - Frontend React application
- `server/` - Backend Express.js API
- `shared/` - Shared TypeScript schemas and types
- `migrations/` - Database migration files

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses four main tables:
- **users**: User authentication and management
- **portfolio_items**: Individual investment holdings with purchase details
- **market_data**: Real-time market data for stocks and indices
- **news_articles**: Financial news articles categorized by region

### API Endpoints
- **Market Data**: `/api/market-data` - Fetches current market prices and indices
- **Portfolio**: `/api/portfolio` - CRUD operations for portfolio management
- **News**: `/api/news` - Financial news with category filtering
- **Analysis**: `/api/portfolio/analysis` - Portfolio performance analytics

### Frontend Pages
- **Home**: Dashboard with market overview and quick actions
- **Analyze**: Portfolio input method selection (manual vs CSV upload)
- **Add Data**: Manual portfolio entry with form validation
- **Upload CSV**: Bulk portfolio import with data validation
- **Portfolio Report**: Comprehensive analytics and optimization suggestions
- **News**: Categorized financial news feed

### Storage Layer
The application implements a storage abstraction layer with both in-memory (development) and database (production) implementations, allowing for easy testing and deployment flexibility.

## Data Flow

1. **Portfolio Input**: Users can add investments manually or via CSV upload
2. **Data Validation**: All inputs are validated using Zod schemas before storage
3. **Market Data Integration**: Real-time price fetching for performance calculations
4. **Analytics Generation**: Portfolio analysis including P&L, asset allocation, and risk metrics
5. **Reporting**: Visual charts and optimization recommendations

## External Dependencies

### UI Components
- Radix UI primitives for accessible, unstyled components
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Lucide React for consistent iconography

### Data Processing
- Date-fns for date manipulation
- Zod for runtime type validation and schema definition
- React Hook Form with resolvers for form management

### Development Tools
- ESBuild for production bundling
- PostCSS with Autoprefixer for CSS processing
- TypeScript for static type checking

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- Uses Vite dev server with HMR for fast development
- TSX for running TypeScript files directly
- In-memory storage for rapid prototyping

### Production
- Vite builds optimized frontend bundle to `dist/public`
- ESBuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- PostgreSQL database with connection pooling
- Autoscale deployment target on Replit

### Environment Configuration
- Database URL configuration for PostgreSQL
- Separate development and production modes
- Port configuration for Replit deployment (port 5000 â†’ 80)

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation of concerns, type safety throughout, and scalable deployment patterns suitable for both development and production environments.
